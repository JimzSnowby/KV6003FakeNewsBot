@HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Yes it does!
In 1911 - Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen became the first man to reach the South Pole. He reached the destination 35 days ahead of Captain Robert F. Scott.  In 1918 - For the first time in Britain women (over 30) voted in a General Election.
@UKLabour @YvetteCooperMP It’s reasonable for all to pay a small GP visit fee = huge difference to the system. I pay a spousal VISA £1050 NHS levy as part of my right to live in the UK. This could reduce if all immigrants shared the cost, not just select countries such as commonwealth countries i.e. Oz

@graham_budden @BenPBradshaw @UKLabour Thank you. You have been amazing the entire election. We will rise like lions
@jwb49079 @HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Her arrogance is par for the course.
@D_Blanchflower @jeremyccorbyn @UKLabour By overseeing the post-election period of reflection, he expects to influence the party’s future direction. But I agree that this is inappropriate. The party would be better with him reflecting on his own on a beach somewhere.
@spaceangel1964 @peoplesvote_uk @16MillionRising @Another_Europe @hopenothate @Conservatives @guardian @jessphillips @mikegalsworthy @Femi_Sorry There’s been a referendum And a General Election that’s proved more people want Brexit. Suggestions of fighting to return now are laughable and stating that “it’s YOUR Brexit now” is silly!  where will you be then?
If the UK election is anything to go by, it's most certainly that the United States will cease to be a democracy after Nov 2020 since twitter opinion appears to be the polar opposite of what happens in real life
@BenPBradshaw @MattJLloyd @UKLabour Labour abandoned the people in order to please a narrow liberal metropolitan elite.  Working class voters left it for a reason.

It's an open secret BoJo's Tories fear Jess the most.
@bbaby_xx Has he made any insightful comments about the UK election?
@sturdyAlex @ayeshahazarika ???????? hear hear ????????   @UKLabour needs to smarten up and grow up way beyond these lot.
@HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn It feels like a replay of the self same character defects so clearly on show in the AS complaints.  He is going to cost the Labour Party a fortune.
@cyberneticbussy Trust me the latest election ended him being second cause people saw what happened in America and now with the UK results I need to tell you guys about him in case SOMETHING goes wrong

@jeremycorbyn If you had won the arguments, you would have won the election. And having you as PM was part of your arguments and is which why you lost. The majority of the constituencies in the UK did not WANT you nor your 'arguments', you deluded marxist fool and Momentum puppet
@achanmusic @Conservatives @RichardBurgon Heartlessness.
@diarmidweir @Dazzafulham @PaulEmbery @UKLabour @EddieDempsey Nobody's saying anyone's votes don't have value, just that the working class don't have the advocacy or agency the champagne class do and they need a party that's going to represent policies that help them without further appeasing the class that already profits from their labor.
@SkidRowRadio_YT @boufont_zak @BenPBradshaw @UKLabour It is in no way the fault of the Labour Leadership, the constant undermining by disaffected Blairites , and invented charges of antisemitism laid at the feet of the most anti racist and genuine Politician in the Country, went a long way to this defeat .
Thread of butthurt antisemites after #Corbyn got destroyed! Enjoy ???? #LabourAntisemitism #GE2019 this isn’t about supporting Boris per se but about showing that running on an antisemitic (or antihindu) platform won’t be rewarded. Bernie be warned.

Never felt more disconnected from the political process.  I fear @UKLabour will retract into neoliberalism leaving no hope what so ever in a world of little hope.  @AngelaRayner for PM. We need a straight-talking northerner to rise up and wobble people's heads! ❤❤❤
@johnellison @JSWY303 @EngLabNet @UKLabour John your embarrassing yourself Labour will never ever ever get into ???????????????????????????? again it would have to go independent not remain a branch office.

@DanHolliday23 @feelfascination @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Hope you still cancelled your licence fee though. I did today. It will make you feel better.
@jeremycorbyn If you were truly thinking of the country first, you should have stepped down after you lost the first general election. Your principles may be strong but you do not know how to connect with those whose votes you need to make you a viable electable prime minister
@pressjournal This is the same clown who begged people to vote for @ToriesScots to stop #indyref2 They lost more than half there seats. The people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly for @theSNP

Some truths for the emotionally challenged  American left:   You cannot impeach a President just because you don’t like him. You have to beat him in an election  British left:  If somebody wins your general election THEY ARE you PM &amp; their Party IS your government  Ok?
She had her ego boosted by traitor MPs looking for any port in a storm. She sold her party tradition to accept political whores who denied their constituents any say.

@TracyAnnO @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 @jessphillips is great, one of the few good ones left in @UKLabour, but I think years of Corbyn have ruined them, like a siren call attracting far left, neo nazis &amp; islamists to its ranks while causing moderates to leave. There’s no undoing that. LibDems will be my party now.
@Zero01478478 @LondonLabour @UKLabour That is the country actually not the labour party. Irelivent of the result I have been to a little party with my comrades. And we are ready for the battle. Stop spreading the shit that sticks.
@ordie5w @AlissaVierra Money is indirect factor. He just want to hold on to his seat. Bad political move though. He is gonna lose the election in either primary or general but he definitely will.

The smears by fox news were racist attacks agaisnt Obama because of he was Black.  The two aren't comparable, there were some legit complaints about Corbyn but he was attacked no matter what he did.
@rufusandreggie @cjfaraway @TracyAnnO @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 Now that’s the kind of loyalty to the party we’ve been missing! ‘I’m leaving if I don’t get the leader I want’. I’d love to see @AngelaRayner as leader but if it isn’t then I’ll be standing by whoever it is to get the work done needed. Too many people count on us. Remember that.
@jessphillips @ChantelleJLewis Black @UKLabour activists like myself are seen tokens especially in Birmingham and across the West Midlands where no black MP sits. Being annoyed over something you know is wrong is just is bad in so many ways. This is not any kind of attack Jess just a genuine question. ????

@DeborahMeaden @Conservatives I think a lot of voters simply wanted brexit over with and couldn't see any other way of achieving that. I think they also knew it might mean suffering the conservatives for 5 years but that was the position that was thrusted upon us all. An impossible choice.
@vjl2 @EmmaKennedy @steviweavi @UKLabour I think you’ll find that they tried after the referendum. Corbyn lost a vote of no confidence and most of his shadow cabinet. But then won the leadership contest.

@everywoman61 @Casper10666 @WilliamDuguid1 @StarryGryffin @CraigMurrayOrg A lot of MPs have marginal support. Turning their backs on their constituents means they won't get re-elected if and when the time comes.  I know we'd all like to think that Thursday was the last UK election we'll ever take part in, but what if it isn't?
@EmmaKennedy @UKLabour Only 4 Labour leaders have ever won an election. I want Corbyn as leader until after 31 January. I feel eyes must be on what is happening with the EU not integral party politics.
@OriginalKooLaLa @brogs66 It does, but needs to be purchased; Labour usually purchases general election rolls, I helped with data entry from 2017's batch.  The rolls are just photocopies of the sheets that were in the polling station, which someone would have scored off as you were given a ballot paper.
@simonmccarthy4 @HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Blair made mistakes but look at sure start, min wage, record NHS spending, building schools, low unemployment, peace in NI, lowish inflation, reducing homelessness etc etc. Corbyn lost 2x so has achieved nothing at all.

It’s good to pick fights. @UKLabour needs to be willing to pick fights and even lose some of them. Working people needs to see the party do that.

@Sally_CF71 @julian47hill @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour I agree.  As the Supreme Court said, the referendum result was treated as binding by Parliament, Tories and Labour, cementing the 'honour the referendum' mantra Corbyn is so fond of and making it unassailable. Complicity. https://t.co/30qt0U0NQk
@IAmBodrick @JamesEFoster @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn 2017? Best increase in Labour vote share since Attlee, on similar policies as 2019. Difference? Not Corbyn, or the policies, but in 2017 Labour promised to respect the referendum and in 2019 it didn't.

@cllranderson @jonburkeUK @HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Corbyn made exactly the same mistake on Brexit as Miliband made on austerity, trying to offer a watered-down version of right-wing policy in order to appeal to everyone, rather than taking a principled (&amp; economically correct) left-wing position, &amp; getting out there &amp; selling it.
If lefties can take control of a party but not win a general election then the answer is obvious: We should also install our people as leaders of the Tories and Lib Dems.
@pocodrom @blue_labour @UKLabour Welcome!! Good on you ????????????
@HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn No sympathy for you, or for any Labour MP who went into this election campaigning for a terrorist-supporting antisemite to be PM.

"BBC: ""The Papers: PM's 'Whitehall revolution' after election win https://t.co/jz94BYJsJp "" | @BBCNews https://t.co/JJQyqWMw6W"
So they need the party to ALSO believe that it's simply not possible for ANY MP from the Labour left to have any chance of winning a general election. But the very fact they've spent all their time saying Corbyn was uniquely rubbish means they can't really sell that conclusion.
I’ve been saying that the @guardian has a taint of antisemitism for about 20 years. Nobody listened. Sadly its endorsement for @UKLabour despite antisemitism confirmed my view.  https://t.co/SKMOjIgw6g
@Vsouvatzoglou @HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn By slanderous if you mean institutional antisemitism then why has no one sued? Let’s await the EHRC report (created by Labour when in government and able to, you know, make a difference) and if it is all smears I will be the first to acknowledge I was wrong (unlike Corbyn).

@AlisonEvison @theSNP had Labour and Scottish Labour went all out with its current policies and not procrastinated over Brexit, ie said like the Tories you’d have got it done, you would’ve won,  democracy would’ve won, it was always about Brexit!
@chrisadonnelly Moderate nationalists and the public in general smell @sinnfeinireland fear. They will act upon that scent and further punish them. That's politics, no need to be so sour.

@wallet1348 @Femi_Sorry @JamesCleverly A general election is about a multitude of things. Not just Brexit. Labour lost most votes due to Corbyn not Brexit. A vote for Johnson does not equate to a vote for Brexit. Thought that’d be obvious...

@drmariagee @piggynugget @WokinghamLabour @LibDems Your canvassing said loads of Tories were coming over - they didn't. Redwood lost 3000 votes.   An objective look at the evidence prior to the election showed clearly ahead. £80k of spending buys a lot of persuasion.
We absolutely have to stop the incompetent, hard-right fantasists now in control of the country.  Like it or not - and I don't like it at all - the only vehicle for doing so is @UKLabour.   Unable to resist the logic, I have just become a member. So help me God. https://t.co/SmlltQzHEy
@NathanWidder @sunny_hundal True. But Labour didn't have to accept what the SNP and Lib Dems wanted. Corbyn could have whipped party against General Election. 20 or so Labour MPs did vote against GE in any case. Another poor strategic decision we have to admit from Labour leadership.

It’s tough to swallow, but if (like me) you left @UKLabour because of Corbyn: his stance on EU, failure on antisemitism, and lemming-like pursuit of PR disasters, NOW is the time to rejoin and ensure a viable opposition to 10 yrs of off-the-leash Johnson https://t.co/w6eHeWSONX

@hames_cole A part of me feels with the conditions of the general election surrounding Brexit, the lack of a strong stance on staying or leaving, and an attempt to focus on kitchen table issues missed the mark for the fact that Brexit is upstream of all the issues they tried focusing on
@conserv_ation @paulwaugh @RicHolden Agree. It was always about Brexit and that is why Johnson pushed for a quick general election.  Labour were doomed from the start.

@jonathanfryer @trevdick @Conservatives The most likely route to electoral reform is a hung parliament with a Labour/Lib Dems government, where the Lib Dems have enough MPs to make electoral reform a red line for their support.
@wikileaks Anything about the UK election being rigged by the Tories yet?
@JHenryBucks @Plaid_Cymru If Plaid shifted to a centrist position they would lose the vote of myself and many other Plaid voters I know. There is no point in an independent Wales if it is not a Wales that works for the Welsh people.

@LibDems @markpack Congratulations on your Election. I do hope you won’t be encouraging anti democratic views as dine by your previous Leader. Saying you don’t respect majority votes &amp; if 2nd vote held you wouldn’t accept result if Leave won was a big ERROR then don’t consult at all -just Revoke????

@PeterTatchell @DoominHenry @TheGreenParty @CarolineLucas All true, but answering sectarianism with tribalism and a desperate counter-productive and wrong-headed attempt to increase vote share under FPTP in answer (such as in Stroud) wasn’t the answer either.
@damian_from @MerryMichaelW @UKLabour Agree too, as I wonder too... not sure if next leader can do similar or share similar vote as @jeremycorbyn did. As I’m more concerned about what country voted for...a vile racist far right Tory leader.
@BenPBradshaw @UKLabour Sadly, Corbyn proved that despite a strong surge of membership and a Remain movement building pressure within to make that the party focus, it got sidelined into insignificance each time by him and his advisors. Once he is gone then Labour can rebuild.

@lordofanywhere @scottmcgregor88 @theSNP @StarryTowers @AmyCallaghanSNP Fair enough, but we did say during the 2010 election that it was a possibility - we'd talk to the largest party in a hung parliament - and during this one that it was absolutely not a possibility. There's no way that we can work with what the Tories have become.

Blairite neoliberalism moved the party too far to the right &amp; abandoned the North, the gap was plugged by Farage, aided &amp; abetted by a rightwing msm, then constant attacks by blairites/smears on JC, then push for 2nd ref betrayed heartlands.
@FergusEwingMSP @theSNP @drewhendrySNP I voted SNP but I really wish you would do more to protect our beautiful environment, I'm thinking of the damage being done by salmon farming for example. Think of how you will be looked back on Fergus.

If Labour did so badly why are people queueing up to be the next @UKLabour leader?  Corbyn won more votes than Blair, Brown and Miliband and so has left the party in better shape than they did.  He also tripled the membership to over 500,000 and took Labour from debt to surplus.

@Barristerblog @SCynic1 @FelixBoon @UKLabour 2m. Then I’ll concede, for now, on the reliability of the book, but she still didn’t, as far as I’m aware, take her clothes off and you might have checked. Or is there some inside joke that I’m missing?
@jeremycorbyn You lost @jeremycorbyn. I don’t thing your in any position to tell anyone the way the @UKLabour should be. You just handed the Tory party 10years of power and no opposition. You have no idea what a D*ck you’ve been. You are the poison not the cure.
@JamesCleverly @Conservatives The Conservatives will disappear in a generation. The young will never forget what you have done. Look how many 18-24 year olds voted for you. The only people willing to support you are old, very rich or daft.
Labour hasn't been the party to win the most working class voters in the last 3 elections:  2015: UKIP 2017 &amp; 2019: Cons  A question for the next Labour leader: Is Labour trying to be the party of the working class or the party of students and metropolitan liberals? #GE2019 https://t.co/3oHc7Y2K1O

Never have I seen a huge part of the nation in so much mourning after a general election. The impact JC has had on our lives is simply on another level.

Labour centrists constantly claim Mr Corbyn is unpopular, yet 10.3 million voted for Corbyn’s @UKLabour party.  Mr Corbyn won more votes than Brown, Blair and Miliband, so is evidently more popular than them with the public. https://t.co/9nUtEY2KPE

@right_wing_piss @real_markoneil @justcryhavoc @Red_Labour_ @UKLabour @piersmorgan Oh, sorry. Lol. Boris hid in a fridge when he was supposed to be getting interviewed by Piers and Susanna. I know Corbyn is an idiot (thankfully stepping down for next election) but I mean...this wasn’t exactly bright of old Doris, was it?
Tory minister basically says they don’t know how they’re going to stop the 18500 nurses from leaving, and the 50,000 ‘extra’ will be in 10 years time.   Now what should be my reaction to this revelation?   https://t.co/ZWJgh48V0Q

@neils_bohr_ @StewartMcDonald @theSNP Why would a party who’s main intent is to get scottish independent stand in English, Welsh or N Irish constituencies? People vote for parties for a multitude of reasons like you say, not just on independence. It didn’t include 16-17 yo or EU citizens. Indy isn’t just the snp
@WDavidWork I agree that the general election is currently a tossup. I do think that patterns seem to exist due to generational turnover, but also observe that no great victory is ever won without a hell of a fight.

@HarrietHarman @CyberModerate @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Extraordinary. Classic example of denial. He lead Labour to its worst election result since before he was born and he talks about 2017.  It’s like a Labour myth that they won. Remainers leant their vote &amp; they did better than expected. It was still a loss. Once bitten twice shy.
@EmmaKennedy @UKLabour Why aren't you bothered with why!? Focus on the lies and shite from the media, who should be brought to account.
@indygolfercelt @mstewart_23 The 365 were won in the UK.  The 48 were won in the UK.  The UK is a country and this was a UK general election which the Conservative party won.
@mishtal @UKLabour Corbyn called for the election but he never showed much enthusiasm for being PM. All those meetings he would have to attend, reports to read, a bit like work. Ruin his street cred.

@HarrietHarman @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn You are 100% correct. He's delusional. Time to retire.
Tragic to see so many in @UKLabour in complete denial about GE. It was the Tories fault. It was Blair's fault. It was the LibDems' fault. It was the Labour centrists fault. It was the lying press' fault. It was everyone's fault except that of the party leader and his policies.

@JamesCleverly @Conservatives Already a member. You all did us proud! Thank you @BorisJohnson for putting this great nation back on track. I didn't vote leave, but are nation has proven many times we can stand on our own feet! Can't wait for our 80 strong majority to get working for us all!
@DPThomas10 @NicolaSturgeon @LornMacdonald_ @theSNP So by your logic Boris should cancel Brexit cos less than 50% voted Tory?????  EU immigrants and 16&amp;17 year olds weren't allowed to vote in the GE. They are allowed to vote in indyref. The vast majority of them support independence. Many Labour voters support independence too.

@JamesCleverly @Conservatives And for the avoidance of horrific doubt I didn’t vote for you. Never have.   Everything you represented in this election is populist, dishonest, divisive, xenophobic and shameful.
Arguably the most shocking result of election night, Bassetlaw. It's gone from a 4,852 Labour Majority to a 14,013 Conservative Majority...  Brendan Clarke-Smith was elected the Member of Parliament, the first Conservative in Bassetlaw since 1910.  #BritainDecides #GE2019. https://t.co/ZiA4eFM8yS

@gerrymcculloch1 Have to disagree This weeks general election was a very pointed rebuttal across the whole of the UK around Brexit in our case it was an emphatic ‘We don’t want to leave the EU’ she ran the campaign on that and stated that a heavy win for snp is now a 4th mandate for Indy
@Paul_S_Lovell @Siobhain_Mc @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Carry on mate, carry on letting the Tories win. I’ve clearly stated that the media is biased but that’s not good enough for you because dear old leader can’t be criticised.  People don’t like him. To win, you have to be liked.

#UK election #BREXIT?pollster #JohnCurtice has shown in his analysis that 45%of voters were for #BREXIT parties,52%voted for parties that were for #Remain or wanted a 2nd referendum.

Another reason to move to Austraila  #GeneralElection2019
@wrelton We certainly aren't going to move from 12.5% vote share in European Election to 2.7% vote share in General Election in same year simply because our prospective MPs are four times less popular with the electorate than our prospective MEPs. No the main factor is proportionality.

You'll never be aquited of your evil by us @UKLabour
I don’t understand why a whole lot of politicians/ journos / commentators who are now absolutely irrelevant, are still making noise...  ...and worse still, are being given oxygen by the winners of the election.  Surely, just mute them &amp; leave them to  moan at each other. #GE2019

Thanks, Michael , we all get the irony.  Every democrat who has just voted in the UK General Election should look at and remember this hateful rant by the re-elected MP for Brighton Kemptown. Hopefully his party will learn that his sort of behaviour is why they lost 59 seats. https://t.co/4R9PL6qTHK
@BorisJohnson is the leader of the Conservative party which won the 2019 General Election because he was the best of a bad lot. He will be judged by whether or not he fulfills the promises he made during his campaign. #mendacity #veracity https://t.co/AhmohE3pNn

"@EmmaKennedy @UKLabour Good idea.  Let's have the Labour Party collapse completely into rudderless chaos during the period Johnson ""gets Brexit done"". ????‍♂️"
Just got a dm asking if I'd like a sugar daddy to cheer me up after the general election. Y'all really will use any excuse to slide into those dms, I'm honestly kinda impressed.

- If you combine unionist vs SNP votes up - excluding indy supporters  that voted Lab, Con, LDem and 16/17 year olds and EU nationals that couldn't vote in general elections  - Blaming the turnout - 68-70% - despite the fact is has always been the average in every election

@spaniel5 @TonyM70 @PunkyTeuchter @GaryDeans3 @Femi_Sorry Because a General Election and a referendum on independence are primarily a different subject matter. However, support for a party which is pro-independence implies one is in support of an independent Scotland.

@annif007 @ShehabKhan @UKLabour They choose not to vote labour, i did most of my family didn't how dare you call them racist, whilst labour have a leader with known association with Hamas, IRA praising them whilst slating british troops and his inaction to antisemitism, they will not vote labour.
@altmann_tim @Chiclanagirl @UKLabour 10 years in opposition awaits
@neils_bohr_ @StewartMcDonald @theSNP And it’s also our democratic right to change our minds
OK. In the UK we've just gone through a gut wrenching election. I don't want to pretend that I'm impervious to the results but I do feel like I've been doing work around trying to understand these seemingly random or not... https://t.co/rjw9ZypUq7

Last #GeneralElection2019 thoughts. To keep describing North East regional areas/seats as former coal mining communities is a bit patronising &amp; lazy. Coal mining has been replaced by hi-tech, call centres, subsea, innovation etc Coal was a generation ago. Maybe there your answer.
@GodzillaKong99 @GlitterResist @startmakingsens @TracyAnnO @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 @jeremycorbyn I do think he wanted to win. The party as a whole were not convincing enough, obvs. I know that for many people JC was Marmite.

Any leader who leads his party to defeat after defeat would be culpable.
@GeorgeNewton1 @UKLabour @GwynneMP well said Goerge.
@EmmaKennedy @UKLabour Oh I don’t know Emma, Corbyn was the first and (only for a long time) politician to call out the humanitarian issues in Kashmir by the right wing modi Government of India.

@mstewart_23 You had a vote to leave; bottled it so should just accept the British General Election result.
@andywigmore @LeaveEUOfficial @SKinnock @UKLabour So out of touch with the electorate.
@MrSamiBerhane @damocrat In 2017, millions of remainers lent @UKLabour their vote in the belief Labour could never *not* oppose a toxic hard right policy. But @jeremycorbyn took us for fools and claimed our votes as support for #Brexit and utterly failed to even try to argue against it. #FoolMeOnce, etc.
@jeremycorbyn You’ve got great principles Jeremy, high ideals &amp; revolutionary policies. Great piece for the @guardianopinion . I agree you need the working class to be the driving force of your party, to do that @UKLabour need to share their values. These values aren’t always pretty. ????
@TracyAnnO @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 Sorry Tracy Ann, as someone who isn't Jewish and has been more vocal than most on protecting Jewish people, that you can back Jess Phillips that was virtually silent is truly astonishing.
@rubycramer How does it help Dems prepare for tough general election to continue primaries w/a large # of candidates? Most of current group is highly qualified but only one can win. We are spreading donor dollars,media coverage, and voter support. Time for some to plan the exit strategy.

@PeterTatchell @LambethLibDems @TheGreenParty @CarolineLucas So true! The arrogance of Labour on the ground was unbelievable and really unpleasant.  They positively discouraged their voters from voting tactically in many many seats.
@ROC_DC_KTE To protect my vote I intend to use an absentee ballot for the primary &amp; general election.  I will send each one back by certified mail, return receipt requested.  Before that I will copy them.  Everyone should do this to protect our election.  We can't trust Congress to do so!
Please stop the infighting on the left / centre the only way we are going to beat the tories is if we are united on the left, it’s a near impossible task with the right wing media, multinational corporations and government against us, let’s win together #votelabour #nandy4leader
@jxs606 @tomcoates @mikebutcher UK investment in 5G is minuscule compared to EU.

Anyway, now it's just to get on with life.
@jeremycorbyn @UKLabour RESIGN ASAP TO SAVE YOUR PARTY!!  DROP UR FAR LEFT DRIVEL AND APPOINT A LABOUR LEADER THAT IS TRULY PATRIOTIC TO THE QUEEN AND THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE OF COUNTRY! If you don’t you will be wiped out in the next GE!

@addicted2newz @UKLabour  @jeremycorbyn  I simply cannot understand why you lost, I mean you have such educated caring followers. Can I again ask, do you condone these words in the name of YOUR PARTY?
@mattprescott @eyejosh @HuntedTeamNick @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Can ANYONE explain to me HOW @BolsoverBeast who has devoted his whole life to constituency. Was Pro Brexit. Lost his seat to a Tory. That must hurt!?
Not heard one @UKLabour MP take responsibility for the situation they find themselves in. Still on TV with the same blame Boris or everyone's a racist nonsense. Show some humility, admit you got it wrong, listen to the people or the party is finished outside London.
I can. I blame Ian Blackford and Jo Swinson. Both surrendered to Boris Johnson's demand for a General Election Christmas Prezzie when both knew he'd unite Leave's 52% but the 48% Remain vote would be split many ways. Under first-past-the-post they knew we'd all get fucked. https://t.co/dhy7d4kQQT
@DawnButlerBrent @UncleObama_ @UKLabour Congratulations!
Not surprising ????????‍♂️ https://t.co/ic3AyBdpzo
@DawnButlerBrent @UKLabour Congratulations @DawnButlerBrent
Also, in as much a General Election is an event where the public adjudicates on a number of competing stated positions, you did not in any sense 'win the argument'.
@swainjo @JamesWillby @Conservatives Don't agree.  He's got left wing economics with right wing social policies.  Hence winning the red wall.  Centrists have no home.  I know of moderate remainer Tories who still supported Johnson as they were terrified of Corbyn so wouldn't vote LibDem.
@kevin_j_foster @Conservatives Wouldn't it be a better idea to concentrate on more important issues this week, following 9 years of a Tory Govt? https://t.co/6NoFZgRtlE

@RATM If this isn't in reference to the #GE2019 in the UK it should be because it's very fitting. 5 more years of the Tories punishing the most vulnerable while the give tax breaks to their rich mates and who made sure they were in power, the people that will be hit the hardest.

Plenty of us knew @jeremycorbyn was not on our side. How often did he say 80+% of voters in GE17 voted for leave parties - conveniently ignoring remainers’ tactical votes? How many #PeoplesVote marches did he attend? If @UKLabour had backed #Remain, Brexit wouldn’t be happening???? https://t.co/5QOL89XLC8

Maybe the election was unwinnable for Labour. Do you think the man who led them for 4 years is blameless in that?
Interesting takeaway from #GE2019  Arguments don't have the same rules for winning as debates, or sports, or, well, anything

@philosophrob the polling numbers are false and misleading unless you include trump numbers in the general election.
Is Nigel Farage and his Breixt Party awful? Absolutely. But that's not who UK chose. It was between the Tories (Teresa May, Margaret Thatcher's party) and a Labour Party so fueled by antiSemtism that Jewish Brits feared they'd have to flee. That was this election.
Again, Labour didn’t primarily lose because of Brexit or their policies; it was personal. It’s a politics 101 lesson that is relevant in every democracy: don’t nominate someone everyone hates more than the other guy everyone hates. #GeneralElection https://t.co/fzBCR7Mfob

The Anti meat agenda is problematic, I think we need to be very careful about the words we use, and many farmers are scared by the word rewilding.   We need to be reaching out to farmers, but what I'm hearing from farmers is the Greens are anti farming.

@RussInCheshire @UKLabour @LibDems I think these are important points. However, Labour and Lib Dems have nothing in common. Lib Dems are a bourgeois party dedicated to maintaining the economic system. Labour is a socialist party which should be rooted in a class analysis. There is a fundamental difference.
@SadiqKhan New New Labour is needed Sadiq. @UKLabour needs to reinvent itself with a decent leader like Alan Johnson or David Milliband. They need to forgot Momentum and Unite as powerful voices inside the party if they ever want to get elected. They've gone backwards since Blair
As a Scot, I'm bemused by London media's search for explanations of Labour's #GE2019 car crash. A self-referencing nomenklatura in Scotland hostile to Blair hollowed out @scottishlabour a decade ago. Yet, in our lopsided Union, it must happen to England for it to become relevant.

The majority of people in the UK are not happy with Boris Johnson as PM but under the SHIT First Past the Post system we have it is what it is. The next General Election isn't due until 2024 So it's time to plan to ensure the Tories don't win that.

@Eyesheavenward @kormeleon @carlgardner @mrjamesob @UKLabour I agree with you on that, except that as a LibDem supporter I 'd love to see a more democratic electoral system, and a Lib/sensible Labour coalition.
@TheMichaelMoran @TracyAnnO @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 Neither do I. I'm going to join the Green Party. Left without the abusive racism if momentum, and take climate chsnge seriously, not as a fashionable add on.

it looks to me that if @UKLabour or any other party by any other name representing the working classes wants to win against the establishment they have to acquire their own media outlets that are as powerful as those that the far right currently possess e.g. @BBC or @LBC.

@abcpoppins @KevinAn48751902 @alex_e_king @william_haggis @Annawatton @ayeshahazarika @LibDems Go back to the start. I suggested that any new entity would include more centrist Labour MPs.   As to Labour specifically, they represent one of the two extremes. Why would I want to encourage them to reduce their baggage? The more the better if there is a strong centre party.

@xanthesp @drphilhammond @UKLabour @LibDems Couldn't agree more.    Labour carries too much old baggage to be able to adapt to the problems of the modern world.  They'll still be banging on about jobs and the working class when the robots are running everything - and being programmed to hunt down and kill the underclass.

@MrsAitchBee @LibDems I am really sorry to hear this. My view: Corbyn is culpable. He blocked Remain at every step b4 the GE. The Revoke A50 policy was risky and failed. But I don’t see that LDs assisted Johnson, we fought him all the way. If only LD &amp; Lab could have aligned but imposs with JC at helm

@heronsgrove @little_pengelly @duponline So you will know Northern Unionism has nothing to fear from Dublin in terms of pushing for a united Ireland.
@MickDennisReal Cold hard facts.  Labour lost because they wanted to fight an honest, open general election and thought that they could fight Brexit with normal policies and trying to make it not about Brexit.  I criticised the GE before a 2nd Ref due to this. I hate being right sometimes.

@Stressbaker @PhilipPullman @JamesCleverly @Conservatives Yep, with knobs on.
@drphilhammond @UKLabour @LibDems I disagree.  All the smaller parties should attack Labour ferociously for being a sleazy bunch of deadbeats greedy to play the electoral gaming machine that the Tories invented and installed.  Until Labour embraces PR, they should be pilloried. https://t.co/gGWkhSHkhs
@rob_faraway @chapman020 @UKLabour Oh they won’t. They never do. But they’ve been publicly humiliated, by the public. The silent majority will always win.

Tactical voting was set to be Remainers’ saviour, so what went wrong? https://t.co/szopubuuzL I’ll tell you what went wrong sunshine, people didn’t check the info they were given against local polls and voting records - too many saying vote LD incorrectly!  We tried to tell them.

@jhumus @ayeshahazarika @UKLabour Of course not. No one can predict the future. But I've seen the Labour Party written off loads of times. The EU and Brexit was meant to split the Tories. Instead they went full UKIP and rid themselves of the moderates. It still could happen if its not the right Brexit.
@badscooter @SamGyimah @Conservatives @UKLabour Labour is not institutionally racist and has done more than anyother party to combat anti-semitism amongst it`s supporters.

@jezrileyfrench @Conservatives The UK will need a care service equal to that of the NHS as a whole, eventually. As the population ages, we understand mental health better, and we care for lifelong illnesses of all kinds. The #tories are laying the groundwork for that to be private, for profit from the start.

@HulbertMathew @LibDems Bollocks, Matthew.   Jo got the balance right on Coalition: acknowledging what we did right, apologising for what we got wrong.   The problem we had was that Labour were strong enough and absolutely stupid enough to crush us while the Tories obliterated them.

@Siudan2 @WilsonRM27 @g_gosden That's why the remain parties should've waited and forced a 2nd referendum. Instead they were goaded into a general election that the conservatives knew they would win.
A swath of Southern Democrats switched to Republican after GOP won majorities in both chambers of Congress in 1994, and were mostly fine electorally. Since then most party-switchers have gone on to lose their seats in a primary or general election, immediately or years later.
#UKElection Trump, Morrison and now Johnson...what a trifecta! It says a lot about the nature of representative democracy. Radicals and reformists face an uphill struggle convincing ‘joe public’ to cut the apparent  link between their brain and hip pocket. A dearth of compassion

"4/4 Fast forward to 2019 and @UKLabour mythology argued the manifesto launch would be a turning point. If people loved the 2017 version, they’d go wild for the new document. But people never *did* love the 2017 version. And it was never the reason for Labour’s 40% vote share."
Reflecting some more on #GE2019, it’s clear that @UKLabour’s very poor performance was based on a bad misreading of the 2017 election. They believed a mythology which said the party manifesto had captured the imagination of the public. In fact... 1/4

@tappylappy @UKLabour #Corbyn has done nothing wrong .. losing is not a crime.. the manifesto is his legacy #FortheManyNottheFew the Corbyn phenomenon got over 10million votes and 200 MP’s elected to Parliament and has 500k members. I'm proud of him and what he has achieved for us and for the movement
@Thinningontop @Darksparks1 @LeaveEUOfficial @HackedOffHugh @UKLabour But what sort of complete and utter delusional morons are voting for a cretin like Raab?  This is crude, but it seriously sums up the working class voting for a right wing party... https://t.co/Vdfovxnxj6
@JamesEFoster @UKLabour Call it a strategic retreat. Let them laugh at us and think we're beaten while we build something that will support Corbyn's manifesto and make it so obviously achievable they can't argue. We know we're right and we've 5 years to get it right.

@EvaCMurray @RJJohannson @carterforva @scottishlabour The results of the British general election showed that the SNP took 48/59 Scottish seats in the UK Parliament.  Take if from someone who's country broke away from England in 1776.  I'm just trying to help.

@starryblanket @stevejon38 @LukeSouthworth @Audere2010 @jessphillips @UKLabour It's good to have the discussions without having a Twitter army landing on your head.

@HaggisMuncher74 @theSNP Saying that, articles claim that the economy shrunk because of lack of revenue from oil and gas, people out of work etc in Scotland this last year, so that will be something that the Tories will use against Scotland if and when they feel like it.

I was just encouraging the renewal of your once great party. Surprising that is seen as odd &amp; aggressive.
@JamesEFoster @UKLabour 1/2 Ok. Hear me out. I think we need to play the long game. Socialism will continue to be attacked and derided by MSM. So let them have their way in London.

@HonTonyAbbott @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Thanks for all you have done and continue to do Tony #TonyforPM
CNN Newsroom is discussing UK election and getting it wrong. UK uses first past the post voting. With proportional representation Boris Johnson would not be PM - because 51.4% voted for progressive and centrist parties.

@Shortbloke @UKLabour Yes. Let's return to the good old winning ways of Brown and Milliband.  What lost this election was working class people being whipped up into a racist/xenophobic frenzy by the Tories and their press-baron mates. In five years' time, being a centrist won't heal the misery.

@NatashaFatah @Feorlean @theSNP @YesScot SNP gained 45% of the vote.Surveys showed around 40% of Labour members also support independence.

@columeastwood @SDLPlive @ClaireHanna @BorisJohnson has a majority of 88 including the @duponline we leave the EU on January 31st 2020. If the Assembly is restored will you resign your Westminster seats and return to Stormont.
@DrewG75 Could easily have been worse. 80 majority is a landslide.  BUT: 1 With 6000 more votes in ten of the right places #Tory majority could have been 100. 2 Had the @brexitparty_uk #GE2019 vote gone to the #Tories in a further 25 seats the @Conservatives majority would have been 150.

What are they saying that bothers you? Also what is it about you they mock. I’m wondering what a lot of these constituents think Johnson is going to offer them? Honest questions here. I’m shattered at the results. Also I feel there’s too much hate here.
@UKLabour it’s time to do the right thing for this country.  You didn’t deliver on your promise Sorry @jeremycorbyn and the top table that did nothing but block everything should go not in a few months but know we have been let down and keeping them in is still letting us down.????????

@NewsHour all i care about. Even though i should have known that the party had become toxic, and unelectable in a general election, i feared trump's tweets and the fascists on fox news. Trump's win in 2016, shocked me to my core, and turned me into a cowardly terrified little wuss.

@Andrew_Adonis You're mistaken, Jeremy Corbyn isn't to blame for what happened, his direction is correct to heal UK from Tory neglect.

@alexgallagher2 @ianhamilton1982 @AlisonEvison @theSNP I was polite and forthright.

@rachellstorer @Conservatives Of course you know all about the issues in East Hull. Do you even know where it is on a map? ????????????????????
@LynneBattles @LewisMcKenzie94 @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon Nothing in a general election in anyway confers a S30. It is up to the sovereign parliament not the diddy one with political pygmies. The ones who are a minority in both simply do not have any legal or political mandate based on this result. It’s the constitution stupid!

@Skiplols @Little_G2 @UKLabour Drop them fuckwits into South Yorkshire for a day and let them say face to face what they've just said in London centric.... They wouldn't last 5mins before crying for mummy n daddy Labour's new crew... Jesus wept
@kevinadiamond @AngusRobertson @theSNP @ScotNational Yes we can! You need to contact angus robertson who will fill you in with the technalities. As germany and other countries have done this,so there is no excuse in not wanting independence.
@vespalien @trekkinghero If I cared that much about the difference between Lab and Tory I would be in the @UKLabour or @Conservatives.   But I don't care that much, so I'm @TheGreenParty  And after that I want to see democracy done. Therefore as #Leave has clearly won this election I am happy.    You?
@NingalooBaby @HackedOffHugh ???????????? trouble is the dumbo didn't know which Party to speak up for, not very bright of him because that helped @Conservatives &amp; @BorisJohnson to  Vic TORY! Get It?????  Conservatives = https://t.co/oGIZL9I2dv
@SarveshPattni @TheGreenParty Sar, in exhausted by it all .  All European nations have a social democratic left wing party.  Incremental centrism doesn't feel like the answer to me. What's especially turning me off them if the bitter vitriol of many on here. It doesn't feel like a welcoming place.

@Sillyshib BUT it's not those citizens who are to blame.  We can blame MsM, of course...  But let's be clear: the Tories didn't win this election; @UKLabour lost it.  At the end of the day, it was my party, #LabourParty, that threw this election away.  But, purity - we kept our purity. Yup.
@mimsdavies @Conservatives @cwowomen Not if you paid me a million pounds. That's how it works with the Tory party, right?
@RedRodimus @DanKennett @UKLabour So get into bed with him. I’d rather achieve what can be achieved in power (and make concessions to do so) than remain eternally in opposition and achieve rag-all other than a bigger membership and a bunch of students and old Trots chanting.
@ffotojenic @Plaid_Cymru With great respect I ask why? Why did you vote for a Unionist party that aids and abets a foreign power in the continuation of the British Occupation of Cymru and the  British power elite over our country. Why?
#GE2019 was the most corrupt election I have experienced in my 54 years on this planet. If it weren't for the fact that we are a vassal of the USA, they'd be bombing us back into the stone age as we speak!

@visionsofthefu @BrianSMcL @LewisMcKenzie94 @PA @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon No of course it doesn't. I fully respect people will still argue for other causes even after losing a referendum. They are perfectly entitled to do so. Its a once in a generation vote we were assured by all sides at the time. It creates uncertainty, hatred and division in my view
@RoundLike @JeffBrenton Indeed. I'd think next general election is likely the first Thursday in May 2024.

@AaronWillstweet @Plaid_Cymru I agree there. I think they've fought so hard on Brexit they've forgotten (or placed on the backburner) their core goal. That needs to be the sole focus now.
Most people in the UK have got other priorities than going on a demo with banners saying “No to a Marxist government”, “Momentum have all got borderline personality disorder” or “I don’t worship Jeremy because I don’t have low self esteem.” The silent majority have spoken #GE2019 https://t.co/7NtGAzPhJH

@The_Stit @Plaid_Cymru Like Wales under Labour has been for 20 years. You have a point. But when the LD were down and Corbyn began, PC should have immediately claimed that centre ground &amp; progressed the Party from there. Unless left-wing populism now needed like Sinn Féin in ????????.

That's not what I said. Let's be honest. I said Remainers who are democrats should be welcomed. If you say you are not a democrat then why would you even want to be in the @UKLabour party?  You can still campaign for Remain but you have to accept democratic decisions. https://t.co/nMnEtC5coC
@michael_chessum @jeremycorbyn Unless Labour moves towards the centre &amp; elects someone like Kier Starmer or Jess Phillips the party will be in opposition after a 5th General Election.. But it's your choice!  I voted tactically Labour this time to limit a Boris majority but no-way would I vote Labour under RLB!

@PUSBradders @cupofcontes @TheLoz_UK Okay, so you don’t understand. In an election, there were multiple parties for remain and leave. In a referendum to remain/ leave they would all be added up to either remain or leave. And since remain parties got 52% of the vote, they would win in that referendum.

after UK’s 2019 General Election, we firstly speak to Oxford University’s Danny Dorling and John McClure of Reverend and the Makers. They discuss what Boris Johnson could do to stop the threat of a Jeremy Corbyn-style Labour Party rising ever again, why traditional

@Nickolarge @blue_labour You still lost - the biggest defeat your party has suffered in a general election since 1935
This is bollocks. The general consensus was that if Labour had more credible leadership they’d walk the election. Corbyn was a turn off. Johnson won by default. https://t.co/pgBogtV1KS

@DinoLast @pcnotchtree The only time more people voted for leave than remain was in the referendum - and the terms with which the UK would have exited were not yet known.  The margin of voters between remain and leave parties was higher (in favour of remain) during this election than in the referendum.

@electrayner I hope you are not in inciting riots or violence on the streets of the UK . It's remarks like that that lost you the general election. If you are ever elected the leader of the Labour party it won't be 20 years it'll be a lot longer.

@NomiaIqbal Also the turnout was comparatively low in 2005 (61% compared to 67% in this one), which partly explains Tony Blair’s number of votes in that election. 6% less turnout can make a lot of difference in itself. And of course the last 2 general elections the 2 main parties dominated.

@fatfei_ The SNP won the most Scottish seats in a UK election, they seats are no different to what other parties won in the same UK election, that's how the Government of the UK is formed. It was 1 election not an election for 4 countries,  the same as the Brexit vote, it's  democracy ffs

@labourlewis @FredEWaters @UKLabour look at that torygraph ratio though ????
@BrexitGuard @ver1tasaequ1tas @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @theSNP But the Tories don’t have 50% of the vote so they don’t have a mandate for Brexit by your own logic. In fact in Scotland the snp hold 80% of the seats, the Tories don’t have that claim to fame for England let alone the whole U.K.

@catherinebuca @spayrechaynge @MisterRossyG @EmmaKennedy @UKLabour Brilliant analysis there.  Personally, I’m going to take people at their word when they say that they didn’t trust Jeremy Corbyn to run the country, and cited it as the main reason why they didn’t vote Labour.  Labour need to win their votes back.  Labour need to change, ASAP.
@fraserjfstewart @LloydAMelville And 30% of Lib Dem voters and 9% of Tory voters are open to independence as well! And Finlay is also forgetting the 16/17 year olds who in 2014 voted 70% Yes and EU nationals as well who couldn't vote in the general election

So much whinging from Labourites berating everyone and their dog for the election result. The plain fact of the matter is that there is zero appetite in the UK for socialism. We tried it once and it didn’t work.
@debrakidd @teacherhead @imagineinquiry @UKLabour I have absolutely no issues with Corbyn.  I don't know him, I am not giving him a kicking, I am reporting events from Thursday.  I don't see him as a very skilled politician and he has divided the party since becoming leader not united it.

@colm_m There's quite an interesting analysis here of the 2001 election: https://t.co/yf8WF5kEZV. Note the big cohort differences from the mid-1980s onwards, and among C2DE voters in 2001 (when 18-34 year old C2DE men were as likely to vote Tory as their ABC counterparts)

@SkyNews A GENERAL election is not about the one topic Brexit. A general election is about choosing a prime minister who can deliver on the interest of the people on all aspects. Getting brexit done will not help the homeless the nhs workers the kids from poor families.
Johnson claims that the election gives him a 'powerful new mandate' for Brexit.  I disagree. 52% of votes were for political parties in favour of a confirmatory referendum. 52-48... now, where have we seen that before?  #GE2019 #BrexitShambles
@BenPBradshaw @UKLabour Now the Tories have lurched sharply to the right and the Lib Dems have lost seats thanks to Swinson, there's space to pull Labour back to more centrist ground. I am just not sure this country has appetite for socialism (Sadly). This or spend another decade in opposition....

@tappylappy @UKLabour I'd love Corbyn to stay, he inspired so much hope and is an amazing human being. But I'm worried the character assassination, even though proven false time &amp; time again, means the general public will never accept him or anyone he endorses - can smears be inherited?

@TeamCorbyn4Ever @ITVCentral @jessphillips @UKLabour I don't think they understand that the dynamics of the playing field changes when the voting is membership led....and the conversations are mainly online.....see Us lot online ....We don't read Murdoch press &amp; daily mail ....again they underestimated Us plebs????....  ✊????????️...

@westerby1 @SusanGoodchild4 @joymorrissey @Conservatives You have to claim your state pension. If you don't agree with claiming it at 60 or don't need to, then don't. Defer it and campaign for it to be increased by inflation only until you do claim it.

@JackieFyers @parentchain @deGourlay @shamebanduk I agree actually. I may not have wanted the result that happened on Thursday, but if we don’t accept general election results and a plurality of political viewpoints, then democracy is pointless.

@Maspinall72 @Geoelte_Spinne @SteveRo98629592 @elrick1 @UKLabour I don't mean a two week trip or exchange. I mean full academic year as you'd have at university. Maybe two.  Full on exposure, long term.  I'd also expand that to graduate (research) students, but under different reasoning (research is global and international).

Frankly, I don't care who @UKLabour elects as leader. I'm never voting for Labour again. I don't forgive betrayal.
@JHenryBucks @Plaid_Cymru Makes sense I suppose it was easy for the SNP to be so pro EU because the vast majority of Scots are Pro European and I know that's not the same in Wales

@Y_Wenhwyseg @Vaughan_Wms @Plaid_Cymru A perception developed deliberately by Labour (Welsh Branch) for many, many, years. Have to believe, that Labour will look at the wipe out they have suffered in Scotland &amp; will be prompted to reconsider their anti Welsh, anti Indy stance.
@Kurako76 @Conservatives @brexitparty_uk @MertonLabour @MertonTories @MertonGreens I respectfully disagree.  An MP should be more than just lobby fodder and, as the seven @MertonLibDems councillors on @Merton_Council have shown, good representatives can make a real difference, even if in neither the governing party, nor the official opposition.

@gardensinboots @LibDems I hope this petition succeeds, to the extent such a measure won't cause problems. I must say, I expected to disagree with the petition, until I read it. I am not a Remainer.

#UKElection involved lies and manipulations with cheerleaders in right wing press, it clearly was successful. To this pattern add tactics of moral outrage, stoking fear (migrants, refugees, nanny state, crime) and disinformation campaigns on social media. #rightwingplaybook 4/6
@UKLabour's problem is same as #progressive parties across globe for last four decades:  -the consistent disconnect between the policies needed and those acceptable to centre voters.  Only full awareness leading to  strong strategy can reconcile this schism 1/6
btw just like I don't think you can use the UK election as a statement on the failure of leftist politics, you can't use it as an example of centrism failing. The Lib Dems INCREASED their share significantly (from 7.4 to 11.5%). We all know fptp sucks.

@AndyPeacock999 No, who's ok with the #GE2019?
They agitated for a people's vote,  a second referendum. They got it (in the most decisive form of a General Election) but it wasn't rigged in the way they'd planned so they didn't get the result they were trying to manipulate.  People's vote has taken place, it's over (and OUT).

@l_ghex I support BBC. I also think Kuenssberg gets a lot of unexcusable crap, but she and they did make serious mistakes as the election in particular progressed. I think in general though it is a mix of journos questioning themselves and general exhaustion, which many don't factor in.
@LobsterMagazine The huge Remain AstroTurf campaign was the biggest single difference from 2017 General Election campaign.

@nandmeister @EmmaKennedy @shroppiemon @UKLabour That’s if Johnson turns up, which he probably won’t. Personally I don’t really care s it’s not my party. I’m sure they will get s new leader soon enough. No point in rushing it. I’m sure a temporary leader would be fine.
@philden5 @JZief @Femi_Sorry Okay Phil. Just trying to flag up a numbers thing to you. To answer your question, and I can’t speak for everyone, but I think remainers wanted a 2nd referendum not a general election that put a real deal on the table against remain. I know the result of that would satisfy me.

@BrugesGroup @UKLabour How do they ever recover having sunk so low and encouraged this kind of mentality. The Right shouldn't gloat despite the euphoria of the last 48 hours; a civilised, coherent Opposition is essential to our democracy and needs to emerge, somehow, over the coming months and years.
@lisanandy Lisa. Your integrity shone through in all your pre-election interviews. You and all of PLP must resign the @UKLabour whip and form a new Democratic Labour Party within the Parliament. @PeoplesMomentum will not allow reform from the grass roots. Don't even waste your time trying.

@paulkrugman 1. Corbyn wasn't divisive, he was just portrayed that way by their corporate media (including false accusations of antisemitism)  2. Recent elections in Portugal, Argentina, Finland, Bolivia, and Mexico show that left wing parties can and do win. The UK election was about Brexit

@BenPBradshaw @UKLabour Ben serious question here, what if you are ex Labour and have left because other parties offer staying in Europe (Labour doesn’t) or Scrapping Trident (Labour doesn’t) ... parts of the UK (Scotland and N.I.) showed this at end of this election.

@Jacqui_Smith1 Piss off creep, so called moderates need to own the fact they cost us the General Election. Corbyn is always right, but he was made to abandon his 2017 manifesto pledge to leave the EU. Moderates cost us the election. Own it.
@cocoonfxjames @RaajShamji @Conservatives Sorry you feel that, no arrogance intended. The British public have given us their support and they’re not the few. We now have a responsibility to deliver
@SE25A @JulienHoez @Femi_Sorry It's a bit of a silly point by Femi (but honestly I am not surprised). 52% of votes went to parties that were in favour of a 2nd referendum, 48% to the Tories, Brexit Party and UKIP.  But the UK election system is broken. Until that's done no change...
@content1949 @62WalterP That’s the consequent, and it is valid via induction and/or moral logic (though lots projected a Tory win).  The logic of comparing a UK election centered on brexit, to a US election with completely different context is actually a formal fallacy.
@tigerrector @rN4RzE82xSSg0lT @lhart41 @jeremycorbyn @PeoplesMomentum @UKLabour 10m people voted for this zero attraction in a debate dominated by Brexit and Brexit alone. The policies were not the issue. Going back to Blair (only ever got 9m votes) would gain us absolutely no ground. Anyway, your prejudice aside, if you’re a Labour member, vote accordingly.
@ChrisGDwyer @EmmaKennedy @shroppiemon @UKLabour And he was as useful as a chocolate teapot. We are here because he’s a weakling and a pushover. May used to get off Scot free.

@JamesCleverly @Conservatives Hi James, where do you stand on gaining the support of Tommy Robinson?
#UKElection is not reflective of the #2020Election in the United States. Underneath the bumbling facade, Boris Johnson is an astute and seasoned politician who worked his way up the ranks. Trump is just Trump, a Putin-loving puppet who has polled consistently underwater.
@hackneylad @PeoplesMomentum @UKLabour The result is even more damning, given how woeful the Tories have been on everything from the NHS to Universal Credit. The UK was crying out for a real alternative &amp; Labour failed to provide it. Millions of decent people ditched your party. Please learn else it'll happen again.
@BrianSMcL @LewisMcKenzie94 @PA @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon I don't agree with what you're saying. I believe in Scotland as part of the UK.

One good thing about this General Election is that it has shown the sneering self centred metropolitan elite that there are real people outside of the M25.
@Conservatives lying pieces of shit.  Working class voters will see your true colours when you sell off the NHS.

@JAMESSI26025411 @BorisJohnson @UKLabour That again is just more evidence you clearly haven’t checked the facts.  You would know labour policy on Brexit has remained the same throughout.  But conservatives continued that line.  Again you fell for it. They had 3 years and failed  blamed everyone else.  Watch what happens
The entire remain establishment: “A general election will change nothing”. That aged well.

@gerrymcculloch1 That's one valid way to look at it. My viewpoint is this really was the Brexit election - Scotland said no to Brexit again, so time to decide on an EU future or a UK future. Leave it until after the withdrawal period ends and we are making two major changes instead of just one.
@mishtal @TimesCorbyn @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour Well said David   Telling it like it is

@koal2k @RealClearNews So the election in the UK just happened. I just found out. Which means I can use that to test my hypothesis.

@JamesEFoster @Rosa_Red_ @UKLabour Corbyn the problem? Yet, when asked why, no one could gives a plausible reason.

They kept their heads well below the parapet, ready to sacrifice the Jewish community. Thank God for John Mann, Ian Austin and a handful of others. I don't rate Jess Phillips.

@SanCabraal @davidschneider @Conservatives There's nothing to say. Nationalism is a natural, beautiful thing on which nations were built. It's normal, and indeed encouraged, outside of self-loathing white countries. This kind of ignorance and obsession with manufactured outrage is what cost Labour the election.

Looking at the #GeneralElection19 results for the various former MPs who defected from Labour or the Conservatives. They lost and usually lost heavily. When the likes of Mike Gapes went from over 30,000 to over 3,000 votes, it gives you an idea of an MP's personal vote.

@TracyAnnO @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 I would wait a few months as an increase in membership now might  be taken as support for Corbyn et al and Momentum. I’ll rejoin in February

@UdderAnn @startmakingsens @TracyAnnO @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 @jeremycorbyn What they did was acknowledge that not all labour voters thought that JC was perfect and that there were aspects of his leadership which were incredibly problematic. You can accept that &amp; address it, or carry on burying your heads in the sand &amp; act shocked in 5 years.

@dianecarteruk @Joshua_Upton @campbellclaret @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer I'm not voting for a social democrat leader after the betrayal you showed us. You are arrogant and complacent enough to think we can only have leaders from your side of the party. And we shut up do as we're told.
@PeterTatchell @UKLabour @Conservatives @MakeVotesMatter Every UK government since the current franchise system was introduced is a minority government by this standard. May I suggest that many of the people bringing this up wouldn't be in favour of PR if the party they support had won a Commons majority.
@indyrc1 @rosscolquhoun @theSNP @snp That is the consequence of the district system. LibDems 11 Seats with 3.2 million votes. @theSNP had 1.2 million votes but gained 48 seats...

@ElliotColburn @Conservatives Pure luck to win by such a small margin
@LukewSavage We don't demand purity and most of us don't attack anyone. But we demand the protection of our people and planet, and we are passionate about that. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of us voted for Hillary in the general election. Can we drop the false narrative?

@TracyAnnO @UKLabour @jessphillips @margarethodge @wesstreeting @stellacreasy @RosieDuffield1 but every Govt needs a strong opposition regardless of the size of majority. This one will be weakest ever not least because they’re too busy fighting each other. Blair is a war criminal but at least he got most of the party behind him
@MaxBlumenthal @LeeCamp @TheCanaryUK We’ve just witnessed a UK election showcasing uncontrollable MSM bias, we’re torturing a publisher in Belmarsh, and now we’re taking the politicisation of anti-Semitism to independent media. Then, realise that all these tactics are also being used in the US. Be afraid.
@VictoriaPeckham @thetimes Don’t forget the former traditional @UKLabour voting ex Northumbrian and Durham miners driven by @jeremycorbyn to vote @BorisJohnson @Conservatives , too.  That takes some talent.
@ronanburtenshaw Its those pesky Jews Ronan who control everything That's who Nothing to do with the fact that the leader of @UKLabour has never been seen with a Union Jack or St George flag, is anti-British, anti-West, prefers Hamas Hezbollah IRA Russia Iran &amp; Assad to our allies #ByeByeCorbyn

@JSHeappey @Conservatives Country does that include the billions of people your stupid party, shut out, you lot caused this situation frustrating the UK to get them on your side, twice or three times you failed brexit you will again
What happened in #GE19 to Labour is not a ‘cataclysmic change’ from which Labour cannot recover if it can move away from niche leftists. IF. With a decent leader explaining the problem of Brexit this disaster wouldn’t have happened, Labour Momentum factions decided to risk this.

@TeddyArgentum @ShipMinister @GeorgeAylett @jessphillips I find your tweet sadly lacking in labour values. I am concerned you feel your opinion on twitter matters more than the idea of debate. If you're not a bot, look closely at what the right-wing press is doing. It wants to obliterate @uklabour. The more militant you get...
